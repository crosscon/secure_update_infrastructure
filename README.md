# CROSSCON Secure Update - Infrastructure

This repository contains some additional infrastructure for the CROSSCON secure update toolchain, including:

* The extended manifest generator (`manifest-generator` folder)
* The scripts for generating the proofs for some selected behavioral properties (`proof-generators` folder)
* A minimal implementation of a Firmware Server (`firmware-server` folder)
* An SBOM Verifier Server for on-demand vulnerability scanning (`sbom_server` folder)
* A Status Server to collect update results from devices (`status-server` folder)

A more detailed description of these components can be found in the README files located in each folder.
